# Project Description:
Create HoneyBadger's Custom Power Cards for the Roll20 Virtual Tabletop easier with this GUI tool!

This tool aids in the creation of [Custom Power Cards](https://wiki.roll20.net/Custom_Power_Cards) developed by [HoneyBadger](https://app.roll20.net/users/48576/honeybadger) for the [Roll20 Virtual Tabletop](roll20.net) system.  The currently available predefined macro tags are geared towards use with Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition, but adding custom tags to support any game system will work.

**Requires the "Custom Power Cards" Roll20 API script**
